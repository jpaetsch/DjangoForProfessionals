## Summary
Reading through the Django For Professionals book by William S. Vincent (2019). Each folder contains a different project from the book for implementation practice. Practice using the Django framework, python virtual environments, moving it all within Docker for a consistent development environment, and must-dos to set up for a production environment.

## Setup & Usage
Load repository and use Django manage.py commands / principles for each project.

## Potential Improvements
...

## Technologies
* Django is a fullstack framework but languages primarily include Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.
* Venv is used for Python virtual environments
* Docker
* PostgreSQL
* Other libraries, packages, and development principles touched in especially with regards to performance and security in Django projects

## Inspiration
Did Django development for my 2nd and 3rd work terms, just starting my 4th work term and going to be developing a production-level Django project for that as well so want to really understand the development process, good design principles, and solid security.

## Sources
Some deviations may occur and examples taken from online but the book is the primary source and I follow the examples within it closely.
